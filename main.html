            <p>Game originally meant for someone else, finished with the right person instead. Chaos, puzzles and a lot of laughing at each other’s fails. 
              Also, me sabotaging your moves was the best(sorry again.😅). us switching characters just cause I was not as good, lol. Legit, couldn't have asked for a better duo.</p>

          BEST WISHESS FOR YOUR BELATED BIRTHDAY. [sorry, but as you can see, it's some good work, eh.]

          Hey, thanks for always saying yes to a game when you might have some other work to do,
          always carrying me, and just matching my energy when we laugh together soo loud, my roommates would wake up from their slumber.
          As you turn 28, I understand it feels like a lot, just remember, I will always be available to play with you [usually, ofc.] 

          Thank you for making my late nights more fun, and letting me reel spam you. 

          Yours truely,
          Wario1.
